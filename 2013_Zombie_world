Bob will start the round of game  with B energy. In order to move to the next level of game  Bob need to kill all the N zombie's of game but Bob can select any 1 among N Zombie's of game . If energy of Bob (B) is less than Zombie energy (Zi) of game  then Bob will die & lose the round else Bob will won, during the fighting with zombie of game , Bob player will lose his energy by (Zi%2)+(Zi/2) in game . At any point of Zombie World game Bob will play optimally. Now your objective is to find out whether Bob can reach to the next level of game or not.

Input Format

First line : B & N separated by space
where  
B is the energy of Bob 
N is the number of Zombie. 
Next line : N spaced integers each will represent the energy of zombie in Zombie World video game .

Constraints 
1<=N<=10^4
1<=B<=10^9
1<=Zi<=10^5

Output Format

Depending upon whether Bob can reach the next level of video game or not Print "YES" or "NO"
