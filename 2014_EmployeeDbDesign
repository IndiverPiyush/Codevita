We have Given a list of very unique employee_ids & employee age information, your have to construct a program to support the certain operations. 
There are 2 operations nsert and Query. You can assume  that insert operations are very unique on the employee_id column. Query operations are of THREE types. Both insert & query operations are described as follow.

A {employee_id} {age} 
Operation will add the employee_id & there age.
Syntax: A {employee_id} {age}
Returns: None

Q 1 {employee_id} 
Given Query will search for the records whose employee id isexactly {user_employee_id}.
Syntax: Q 1 {employee_id}
Returns: Boolean [ True / False ]

Q 2 {employee_id} 
Given Query will search for the records whose employee id beginning with {user_employee_id}.
Syntax: Q 2 {employee_id}
Returns: Total no. of count of the records which matches the search criteria.

Q 3 {employee_id} {lb} {ub}
Query will search for the records for which employee id starts with {user_employee_id} & there age is in the range (lb, ub).
Syntax: Q 3 {employee_id} {lb} {ub}
Returns: Total no. of the records which matches the search criteria.

Input Format: 

For each line
either Add (A) or Query (Q) operation or  the end of input represents -1 .

Output Format: 
 In case of Query operation Print the total no.of resultant records

Constraints:
1 <= Total digits in the Employee ID <= 50
20 <= Age <= 100
10 <=lb<= 100
lb <=ub<= 100
Total no. of add operations <= 40000
Total no. of query operations <= 40000
